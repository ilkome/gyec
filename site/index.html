							<p>The Global Young Entrepreneurs Competition (GYEC) is an Entrepreneurial Case Competition hosted by the Oxford Education Group.</p>
							<p>Though there are a wide variety of Case Competitions available for university students – we felt that there was a lack of an equivalent for students still in school.</p>
							<p>As it is arguably even more crucial for those with entrepreneurial ideas and spirit to be able express and pursue them, the GYEC was founded on the premise of encouraging young entrepreneurship across the globe.</p>

								<div class="requir-content js-scrollbar">
									<div class="requir-el">Competitors will be required to submit an entrepreneurial ‘pitch’ of not more than 2,000 words.</div>
									<div class="requir-el">The purpose of this ‘pitch’ is to be able to sell the judging panel a sound entrepreneurial business model. Students should imagine that they are attempting to convince a board of venture capitalists to fund their start-up project to pursue in real life.</div>
									<div class="requir-el">As such, contestants should articulate their ideas clearly, and also demonstrate a degree of financial planning. For example, basic calculations of initial capital requirements or average running costs would be encouraged.</div>
									<div class="requir-el">Importantly, these pitches can be for either for-profit or not-for-profit ideas. </div>
									<div class="requir-el">The use of diagrams, charts, spreadsheets and other forms of visual data and/or analysis is allowed and encouraged if students feel that the inclusion of such will strengthen their overall persuasiveness.</div>
									<div class="requir-el">You must be a full-time student studying in the United Kingdom in order to enter the competition. </div>
									<div class="requir-el">There is no age limit to the competition, but it is primarily aimed at sixth form students looking to apply to university within the same academic year.</div>
									<div class="requir-el">There is no restriction on the number of entries that each school can submit, and students can apply either through their schools or as individual entrants.</div>
